# selenium-codespace-demo

Run a simple Selenium test inside a GitHub Codespace.  Selenium testing in Python automates web browsers to test websites and web applications. It simulates user actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, and navigating pages, then verifies expected results such as page titles or element presence. This saves time, reduces manual testing, and ensures your web app behaves correctly across different browsers.
